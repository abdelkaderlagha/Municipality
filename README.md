# Municioality



Municipality is a web site based on Symfony that provides :

  - Add requests/issues
  - Authentification
  - Ask for meetings / Contact officiels


To be able to use this project:
  - Import and save files from GitHub.
  - Add municipal.sql to your database.
  - That's all :)


### Tech

Municipality uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) - Themes are built for the latest version of Bootstrap!
* [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)- PHP framework
* [Twig] (https://twig.symfony.com/)- Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code.

And of course Municipality itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
